# Rock, paper, scissors
Part of The Odin Project JS foundations course. Built as per task requirements, with additional functionality.

[Live version](https://al-moreton.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

## How it's made?
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First foray into onclick functions, functions with multiple arguments, creating elements using JS, and for/foreach statements.

## Optimisation and improvements
Built a `addToFullGameHistory` function to display the game history as a user plays games, using an array, this might be better if I used an object instead.

I enabled/disabled the HTML buttons depending on the state of the round - if someone wins the game, the choose weapons buttons are disabled until the game is restarted.

## Things I would like to add
- Better design via CSS, using CSS grid so that it's not single column
- Utilise local storage to save game progress
